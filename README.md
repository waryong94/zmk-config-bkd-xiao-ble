# ZMK Firmware for XIAO BLE AAA adapter

ZMK Firmware for the [XIAO BLE 10440 (AAA) adapter](https://github.com/zemm/xiao-ble-adapter) I make for the [Bastard Keyboard](https://github.com/zemm/xiao-ble-adapter) Dactyls. Currently it has the Matrix configurations for the [TBK Mini](https://github.com/Bastardkb/TBK-Mini) (lightly tested) and [Skeletyl](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Skeletyl) (not tested!).
